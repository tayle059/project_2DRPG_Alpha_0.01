# How to work in this repo
- Engine: Godot 4.x, GDScript.
- Folder layout under /src: world (overworld), battle (combat), ui, systems, maps.
- Data is JSON under /data (actors, abilities, items).
- Goals:
  1) Implement ATB battle system (Wait/Active).
  2) Data-driven actors/abilities/status effects.
  3) World scene with random encounters -> Battle scene.
- PR style: small, tested changes with brief rationale.
